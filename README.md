# MORSE-CODE-TRANSCEIVER

The project has 2 parts the Transmitter and Receiver, these 2 parts have their hardware and software implementations to work, the transmitter get the input message to be morsed from the user and then gives out the message signal through the LED connected to the circuit, and this led blinks concerning morse code, after completion of blinking for every letter given in message prints its respective morse code along with the letter and thus the message is encoded and also sent between people secretly and also people don't need to learn morse codes when these programs help them to encode the messages at ease as typing in chat services, the receiver has an LDR that receives the light that is encoded and sent through transmission and here this light emitted by the LED is converted from light into text and this text is displayed in the serial monitor along with its respective morse code this making the communication secure and also the need of human morse encryptors and decryptors to send and receive morse code is not required as the computers can do it these days more secure fast and also efficiently.
